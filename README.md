# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using that DataFrame, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The graph then allows Pyber to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

## Results:

The data shows that the average ride per driver is significantly less than the average fare in *urban* cities. Conversely in *rural* areas the average fare per driver is much higher than the average fare per ride. In *suburban* areas the average fare per ride and per driver are much closer. 

## Summary

It is clear from the data that there are more drivers in urban areas than there is a demand for; and there appears to be a much greater need for drivers in rural areas. The suburban fare data would indicate a more optimal ratio. Pyber should use this data and other data points not collected here like length/distance of each ride to determine how to **increase** its driver count in rural areas while **decreasing** it in urban.
